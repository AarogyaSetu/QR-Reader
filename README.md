Aarogya Setu QR code Scanner

A very simple demo app explaining how to build an Aarogya Setu QR code reader to verify status of any user.

AarogyaSetu app does have a reader built in, but the architecture is such that if any developer wishes to read the signed QR code generated by AarogyaSetu backend to verify users AarogyaSetu status they can do the same in respective apps / platforms. The QR code status is valid for 45 minutes only.

Improvement and Idea's welcome :)
